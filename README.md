# TaxiMo
TaxiMo is a fullstack taxi booking application designed to simplify and modernize urban transportation. The system enables users to request rides, track drivers in real time, manage payments, and review trip history across devices.

## Demo Driver Account

For seminar requirements and testing purposes, a demo driver account is available:

- **Username:** `driver`
- **Password:** `test`
- **Email:** `driver@taximo.ba`
- **Phone:** `3876243190`
- **License Number:** `BIH-2022-025`

This demo driver account has the Driver role assigned and can be used to:
- Login to the driver mobile application
- Access the driver home screen
- Test driver-specific functionality

The account is automatically seeded when the application starts and is idempotent (no duplicate records are created on subsequent application starts).
